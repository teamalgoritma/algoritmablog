      <description>Introduction Cause has been people&amp;rsquo;s curiosity for a long time, you can see that people often ask &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; to things happening around them. But do we actually know how to explain &amp;ldquo;cause&amp;rdquo;?
Do we jump to conclusion of causal relationship often too quickly?
Can association between factors that we call mathematically &amp;ldquo;correlation&amp;rdquo; tell us possible causal relationship? No. Correlation shows whether two variable go up or down together. But just because two variables go up together doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it affects each other.</description>
