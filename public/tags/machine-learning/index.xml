      <description>Support Vector Machine (SVM) Support Vector Machine is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm which can be used both classification and regression. In this algorithm, each data item is plotted as point in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, the algorithm perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well.
So how does SVM find the right hyperplane?</description>
